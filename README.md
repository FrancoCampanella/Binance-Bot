The main idea of the following development is to analize a crypto ticket and their fluctuations using differents kind of indicators and combination of them to detect when a change of tendance is happening. That condition would help the user to make any desicion, as enter long or short into the market.
## Binance-Bot code (Partially deployed)
This code contains a python-binance trading bot partially deployed witch is designed consuming the Binance API to read the BUSD/BTC ticket price and to make the sell or the bougth operations in each detected scenario. To use that API the user must have an specified IP adress witch corresponds to the VPN public adress of my PC, so in the execution of the code "Binance_bot.py" you will see an error on the lign 33.

## prueba code (Partially deployed)
On the other hand we have the "prueba.py" code witch contains a quickly test of the second API that I should use at the end of the development, Telegram API. The purpuse of that API is to comunicate me the changes of tendances in the parity BUSD/BTC, conditions witch are usually used to make any operation.
